## Description
A group project done with seven partners in Eclipse. It involved an agile (SCRUM) development approach alongside the version control GIT. The program uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Swing Components (JFrames, JObjects, etc.), and a database programmed in MongoDB to create a TV-Show-Tracker. The software aims to store, access, manage, and manipulate a set of data that specifically relates to TV shows and movies that users have watched or would want to watch.
