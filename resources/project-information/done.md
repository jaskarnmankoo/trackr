We will be done a User Story when:


- The feature is implemented.

- Each feature passes all their unit tests. 

- When people in their respective teams (front-end and back-end) have peer reviewed each other's code for said feature.

- Each feature is well-documented. (Additional)


Any other additional criterion of success (CoS) can be found in the Product Backlog. 

With this in mind, every feature we have planned for the Desktop version should run and work properly by the end of this project. Bonus goals would be to have a working mobile app that goes along with the Desktop. This is only if time permits and we get done the Desktop App.
