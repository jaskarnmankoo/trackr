# Process - Sprint 0

### Team synergy
Our team was able to collaborate sufficiently to create and eventually
compromise on a final intellectual property to work on. We took on Faiz's idea
of an online/offline episode list tracker that would keep track of TV show
episodes as well completed seasons of a series that can be shareable within and
outside the app.

### First meeting
During our first official meeting, we talked about our ideas and what the
project meant to us and where we wanted it to go. Most of our decisions were
based off on majority. We have a very open forum when it came to ideas. The
division of work eventually came on who would be most comfortable with whatever
part of the tech stack they choose to be on. Since we have 7 people, we would
have 2 on the front-end, 2 on the back-end, and 3 on a full stack
responsibility (these were comfortable in jumping in between).

### Tools
We will be using tools that are already built in GitHub like Projects (a kanban
board). Michelle and I briefly talked about our Git workflow that focuses on
making sure that the `master` branch would be clean and out of clutter. Issues,
bug fixes, and other features should have their own branch. Any kind of hotfix
can be done on `master` but should it be necessary, will have its own branch as
well.

Slack will be our formal place of communication. Clarenz took down contact
information in the case that we needed to contact each other right away.

### Prioritizing our project deliverables
Considering we've only met once and our team was only finalized on the week
before Sprint 0 was due, we haven't completely figured out what our user
stories and the personas that we have to work with. As of writing (January
31, 01:05AM), there has been little talk about prioritizing user stories.

The frequency of our meetings have been decided to be once every week right
after our 301 class.

### Decision making
It was a mission for us to make decisions, so as per Michelle's suggestion, we
plan to buckle down and build a more accessible communication system so that
our thoughts and ideas would be easily opened up to the team. The team can then
discuss whether or not the idea is worth the work.

When it comes to due dates, although the due date is a Thursday every week,
we will make sure that we have something working by the day before so that
any kind of testing, debugging, or further discussion on a project feature
would be worked on before pushing to master.

### Important Note
The original repository the team worked on was not viewable by Ilir nor the TAs. After speaking
to Ilir he advised us to simply just make a new repository (which he and the TAs can see) and
copy all files over. We managed to import our entire project over to the new repository (Kanji-Crew), 
however lost our pull requests and issues on the github system. Luckily, our entire commit history 
is still visible still. Sorry for the inconvenience.
