# Product Backlog

Our team will be using the [Fibonacci Sequence](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FibonacciNumber.html) as the numerical series to estimate the cost of each user story.

Our most important User Stories will be: `0, and 11` for the next Sprint.

### User Stories
**User Story 0:** As a user, I want a way to display the shows and movies I have watched in lists, so that I have easy access to my whole watch history.

**Priority:** 1  
**Point Estimate:** 1  
**CoS:** The list should take the form of a top down list, with each row having a different show.

**User Story 1:** As a user, I should be able to sort and filter my shows/movies from a list based on certain attributes I specify, such as their name, rating and genre. This is so I can see easily find a show I am searching for.

**Priority:** 2  
**Point Estimate:** 3  
**CoS:** If I do not specify attributes, the list should stay as is. If there is no show that meets the attribute specifications, I should get no results.

**User Story 2:** As a user, I want to be able to add a show to track on Trackr by searching for it via criterion like rating, genre, already watched etc. into a list. This is so that I can easily find shows that fit my desired specifications and add them to the tracker.

**Priority:** 3  
**Point Estimate:** 5  
**CoS:** If no show meets my specifications, the app should notify me so. It should also add it to the list that is tracking the user's shows.

**User Story 3:** As a user, I want Trackr to be able to recommend shows to me, based on my recent watch history, and also based on what other Trackr users are watching. This is so that I can watch shows that are similar to the ones I have seen already, or shows that are growing in popularity among other users.

**Priority:** 4  
**Point Estimate:** 34  
**CoS:** Given two users, Trackr should recommend to User1, shows that relate to shows in User2's watch history in regards to their genre, studio, etc. It should also reccomend other shows based on the user's own watch history.
