**Competition**

*Rotten Tomatoes*
- Ratings on movies
- Information about movies
- No user accounts

While Rotten Tomatoes reviews movies based on ratings from critics, Trackr's reviews all come from the userbase. Our audience would be one that prefers the public voice on the rating of a movie. In addition, Trackr also lets a user record a history of watched movies. Rotten Tomatoes does not have this functionality, and is unlikely to implement it as they do not have user accounts on their site.

*Metacritic*
- User ratings of movies
- User ratings of games
- Information about movies
- Information about games
- Cannot record history

Metacritic contains reviews from both the user base and dedicated critics. They do not solely focus on movies, instead preferring to spread out to multiple fields like games. Our audience consists of people who are strictly looking for movie related reviews and content. Metacritic does not allow a user to record a history of movies they've watched, nor do they recommend movies for people. Implementing a history of watched movies is possible, however recommending is very unlikely, as metacritic contains various different types of content.

*MyAnimeList*
- User ratings of anime
- Information about anime
- User accounts record history
- Recommends shows based off friends list

MyAnimeList is strictly limited to anime, and not movies. However, in terms of functionality, it is very similar to what we are aiming to build. MyAnimeList lets users post reviews on animes, record history of watched animes, and recommend animes based off what their friends have watched. Our audience would be looking for a service similar to MyAnimeList, but for movies. It is extremely unlikely for MyAnimeList to branch out their service to include movies.
