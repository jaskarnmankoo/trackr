## Project Summary ##

# Key Objectives #
The main objective of this project is to develop a desktop application focused around storing and maintaining TV shows and movies. After making
a free account, users are then able to utilize the software to store and view their collection of TV shows and films in an clean and straight 
forward fashion. These include all those that they have already watched and also can include those they wish watch in the future. All users have 
default access to two primary lists: a publicly viewable list, and a private list. For every TV show and movie within our database, any user has 
the ability to give it both a numerical rating and/or a written review. Then by using this information the application will perform *smart* 
recommendations for users based on their tastes, such as genre. The application will also incorporate a *friends* system which will allow any two 
users to become friends with one another, allowing them to view each others lists and send messages to one another via a simply messenger. Lastly, 
the software will have both an online mode, where users can look through our actively growing database of films/TV shows, and an offline mode where 
they are able to look through the last version of the database which they have on their computer.

# Key Users #
For the generality of this project summary the team created three personas to best help describe the possible usage for this application. Below are 
those personas:

**Bob**: A 20 year old male and a university student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto. He watches between 20-30 hours 
of TV and movies a week, a real fanatic! Bob has finally decided to track all the media he has watched however has failed to come across any applications
 that give an easy and user-friendly experience. 

**Dave**: A 17 year old male and a highschool student applying to the university of his choice. Dave is a social person and enjoys speaking with many
other people. As a result, he doesn't always have the time to watch TV shows and films. He finds himself feeling excluded in conversations that involve
up-to-date information on TV shows and films that he doesn't always get time to watch. Dave now finds himself in search of an application that will help
him keep track up his own progress, while also giving him recommendations to watch, allowing him to expand his horizon.

**Jake**: A 30 year old male whom works as a technical specialist. Jake loves to give advice to others and help them. On the side he enjoys watching 
and reviewing the lastest episodes of his favourite shows, however, he has no real way of getting these reviews to a greater audience. He enjoys this pastime so much, that he is now looking for an application which will allow him to easily keep up with and share his reviews for his favourite shows.

# Key Scenarios #
Below are two possible scenarios which demonstrate how the above personas could possible use the application:

**Scenario 1:**
Dave is finally able to get home from school and finds himself in a strange situation; he has no homework he needs to do for today. Realizing this, 
Dave pulls out his laptop, logs onto Trackr and reviews his list of shows. He finds that he is not in the mood for any of the shows he has listed as 
*wish to watch* nor is in any mood to rewatch a show he has already watched. Dave then decides to use Trackr's recommendation system to find a new show 
that might fulfill his need. After reading some reviews on the shows Trackr recommends for him, he finally finds one that piques his interest. He then adds 
this to his public list under the *currently watching* section, logs off, and proceeds to go watch the show.

**Scenario 2:**
On a quieter day of university, Bob finds himself talking to his school friends due to a lack of work needing to be completed. He soon discovers 
that his one of friends, Ashlen, uses the Trackr app just like him! After discussing the application with Ashlen for a bit, Bob decides to pull out his 
laptop and add her as a friend so that they can chat and share their lists with one another. Later that night, Bob logs back onto Trackr and decides to 
look through what Ashlen has watched so far. He finds a show that piques his interest and so decides to add the show to his own list, and proceeds to 
watch said show.

# Key Principles #
Below are three principles the team has deemed important so far:

**User-Friendly:** The user must be able to easily learn the application. It should be user-friendly in terms of user interface, all while allowing for 
more complex actions. Users must never feel out of place when using the application, regardless of how technically efficient they are.

**Efficient Storage:** The application needs to store its data on shows and films efficiently to allow for easy and quick fetching of data. It should 
also manage the data effectively in both the offline and online mode, where swapping between both modes has no harmful effect. This may cause the user 
side of the application to hold more data.

**Protected Data:** A User data is important to them, thus important to us, and so should be protected. The application needs to implement a way of 
protecting data the user stores, whilst not affecting performance. It should also keep up with information security standards when it comes to securing 
data at rest and in transit.
