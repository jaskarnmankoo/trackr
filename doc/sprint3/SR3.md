# Sprint Retrospective Meeting 3
#### Participants:
Andrew, Daniel, Faiz, James, Jaskarn, Juwon, Michelle

### Unfinished Tasks
- None

### Practices to Continue

- Branch naming conventions

### New Practices To Use
- None

### Practices to Stop
- Working directly on the master branch

### Best Experience
- Watching the app develop from Sprint 0 to Sprint 3 in accordance to our initial vision for the project

### Worst Experience
- Not consistently managing time well
	- Sometimes rushing certain features towards the end of the sprint
	- Led to spending extra hours on certain days that bled into school schedule

### What did we learn?
- It's better to work collaboratively than to work separately:
	- Even if a task is assigned to you and you alone, it is good to ask teammates to critique your work so that it can be better
	- Teammates also can help you tailor your work to be more compatible with their own work, so that when you combine your features, it goes over seamlessly
