# Sprint Retrospective Meeting 1
###### Participants:
Andrew, Daniel, Faiz, James, Jaskarn, Juwon, Michelle

### Unfinished Tasks
- No unfinished user stories from Sprint 1
### Practices to Continue
- Pull request system
    - Allowed us to merge our features seamlessly together with no conflicts
- Branching conventions
    - Allowed us to clearly separate and delegate user stories to team members
    - Allowed us to recognize which branches were relegated to features, bug fixes, experimental features, etc.
### New Practices to Use
- Javadoc all new classes and functions implemented
    - So that other team members can easily understand our code and how to use it
### Harmful Practices to Stop
- Stop talking on Discord, start using Slack
- Skimming over logistics requirements
### Best Experience from Sprint
- Quickly established program framework
    - Allowed the rest of the group members to implement views immediately, so we didn't waste time
### Worst Experience from Sprint
- Forgetting about doing logistics until the last minute
