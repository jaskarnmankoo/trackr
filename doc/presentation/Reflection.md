# Reflection  

## Tools, Techniques and Conventions that Worked  

To start, our method of communication was Slack, and through integration with GitHub and Pivotal Tracker all group members were able to keep up with each others' work. Slack also allowed a way for the group to speak to one another and decide a schedule for working together. Moving forward, GitHub allowed for the use of branches and most importantly the pull request system. During the process of building the application we chose to create and work on separate branches for each story/part we covered. This, along with the use of pull requests allowed for reviews of code and design before submitting to the master branch. Lastly, the choice for us to have weekly meetings on every Friday helped tremendously. These meetings consisted of discussing the progress of individual aspects of the project by each person and planning how to tackle other aspects of the project.

## Tools, Techniques and Conventions that Didn't Work  

Like above, the team tried many tools and conventions and came across two main problems. The first of which was the decision to switch to Maven half way through the development of the application. The original purpose was to avoid the need for installing user libraries via .jar files. However, problems quickly arose as some of the team could not get Maven to work, thus hindering workflow. This led to Maven being dropped and the team reverting back to our original method. The other problem we faced came from how we divided work and paired up to finish said work. For most of the project backend and frontend were kept separate from one another which created a dependency problem. Throughout the development process backend would need to wait on frontend to complete the UI before moving forward with connecting the application. This led to delays and less time for testing.

## The Ideal Work Process

If the team were to stay together and begin another development cycle for the application then the following few changes would be put into place. The ideal new process would consist of four major components. The first of which would be pre-planning how to go about parts of the project, followed by assigning tasks. Next, we would split into teams (a frontend, and backend preferably) and each team would begin a design phase for their assigned tasks. After each team has their designs approved by the entire group, they would make a separate branch and begin the coding process. Finally, once the programming phase is completed it would go through a review (via GitHub pull request) and if approved, it would be merged into the master branch. Overall, the key difference from the process we used for this project compared to the ideal one above is the addition of step two as that portion caused the most problems for us during the development cycle.
