# Sprint Retrospective Meeting 2
#### Participants:
Andrew, Daniel, Faiz, James, Jaskarn, Juwon, Michelle

### Unfinished Tasks
- None

### Practices to Continue
- Re-enforce branch naming conventions
- Continute communication & pull request system
- Assigning tasks/user stories immediately at the beginning of the sprint so we can organize ourselves and promptly start working

### New Practices To Use
- An in-sprint/periodic deadline every 3 days so that we keep group members accountable for their work, and group members are continually aware of what teammates are doing and what is expected of them
- Two person pull request system instead of one person (So that features have multiple reviewers before they are merged into master)
- Every pull request now requires javadocs and CRC cards for new classes to be approved for merging
- Gradually build parts of the feature you are working on and push changes repeatedly
- Front-end communicates with back-end for features they need (Both are intertwined tightly in this sprint)

### Practices to Stop
- Ignoring changes to pull requests (When changes are made to a pull request, assigned reviewers should redo the process of accepting or denying the pull request)
- Pushing the whole feature at once (frequently happens at the end of the sprint) as opposed to gradual changes

### Best Experience
- Smoothly integrating back-end & front-end together for our application to work as intended

### Worst Experience
- Deliverables delivered too late (didn't allow enough time for comprehensive review of certain features and as a result, made the group rush things towards the end of the sprint)

### What did we learn?
- How to fix merge conflicts
- Learned about dependencies between front-end and back-end that need to be handled more efficiently than in past sprints
